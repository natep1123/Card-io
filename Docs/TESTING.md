## Summary

The custom Babel config for Jest is incompatible with Next.js 15â€™s preference for SWC and strict Babel rules, causing Vercel build failures. Initially, issues arose from conflicts between CommonJS and ES modules. The `npm run build` command fails when `babel.config.json` is present. To resolve this, I converted the file to `babel.config.json.bak` and added the following scripts to my package.json:

```json
{
  "build": "rm -f babel.config.json && next build",
  "test": "cp babel.config.json.bak babel.config.json && jest"
},
```

- Testing works by creating `babel.config.json` from the backup file before running `jest`.
- Building works by removing `babel.config.json` before running `next build`.
